# Covid19-Tracker
A simple discord bot that will track the current amount Covid-19 cases, and any publically shared information shared by the CDC

# How to setup
Simply replace the token string in config.json with your own bot token. After that, simply run bot.js
Give the bot 10 seconds to run before running a command, this is because I don't know javascript and this is my only way of setting an interval.

# How to use the bot?
Simply join a voice channel as an admin and type !cv cases.
Feel free to type !cv help to view all commands.

# Where are the stats coming from?
