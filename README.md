# Covid19-Tracker
A simple discord bot that will track the current amount Covid-19 cases, and any publically shared information shared by the CDC

# How to setup
Simply replace the token string in config.json with your own bot token. After that, simply run bot.js
Give the bot 10 seconds to run before running a command, this is because I don't know javascript and this is my only way of setting an interval.

Requires Nodejs 12.x obviously.

# How to use the bot?
Simply join a voice channel with the permissions to manage channels and type !cv cases.
Feel free to type !cv help to view all commands.
Be sure the bot has access to view the channels so it can update!

# Why is your code so sloppy? 
I am extremely new to Javascript so I am still unfamiliar with how anything works. Coming from just Java, C# and C++, this feels a little different. As for my bad programming practices, I plan on fixing everything in the near future, this was just something to teach myself!

# Where are the stats coming from?
